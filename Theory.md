# ðŸ§  THEORY: Self-Funding Community Care Through Bitcoin

---

## Premise

_Little Flame, Big Flame_ is not just about candles. Itâ€™s about proving that:
- Youth labor can be dignified and fairly paid.
- Mutual aid can be structured, not chaotic.
- A micro-scale program can bootstrap itself **without grants, debt, or dependence.**
- **Bitcoin (BTC) can fund real workâ€”not just store wealth.**

---

## Why Bitcoin?

Bitcoin offers:
- **Censorship resistance** â€” ideal for community programs that serve overlooked or politically inconvenient groups.
- **Treasury durability** â€” it can appreciate, preserve purchasing power, and operate outside traditional banks.
- **Direct public support** â€” people can donate without intermediaries, anywhere in the world.

## How It Works

1. **Candle Revenue Model**
   - Two pricing tiers:
     - $25: Accessible
     - $30: Supporter
   - Accept BTC directly for either tier.

2. **Payroll Allocation**
   - $12/hour paid to youth in cash (from accessible tier funds).
   - BTC revenue is used to:
     - Offset wages
     - Grow a BTC treasury
     - Fund care expansion

3. **Reserve Strategy**
   - BTC held in a multi-sig or cold wallet until needed.
   - Treasury published monthly.
   - Forecasts modeled with long-term BTC growth (non-speculative, scenario-based).

## What Weâ€™re Trying to Prove

- That BTC can **replace grant funding** with real-time customer support.
- That BTC + transparency = trust-based community financing.
- That small local projects donâ€™t need permission, paperwork, or platforms to succeed.
- That BTC can become the **funding backbone of dignity-driven micro-economies**.

## Risks + Acknowledgments

Weâ€™re aware of:
- BTC volatility
- Regulatory ambiguity
- Need for consistent BTC adoption by supporters

But we believe that pairing **honest labor + BTC transparency** is worth testing.  
This project is our proof-of-concept.

## TL;DR

**Weâ€™re building a candle-powered treasury of grit.**  
If it works, others can fork it. If it fails, it fails in the open.

We think itâ€™ll burn bright.
