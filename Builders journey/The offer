# Builder's Log – 2025-06-01

## Title: The Offer

**Summary:**  
Today I spoke to both girls about *Little Flame, Big Flame*. I didn’t offer an activity — I offered a role. I told them clearly: if they want in, they have until Tuesday to reach out. If I don’t hear from them, I’ll keep building without them. There will be no hard feelings, no resentment — just love, always. But I won’t chase.

**Reflections:**  
- My fighter niece laughed and smiled. I couldn’t tell if it was nerves or excitement — probably both. But she heard me.  
- The older one asked how big the candles are supposed to be. I told her: that’s part of *her* job. That seemed to matter.  
- I told them they have to work together if they join. Big sister has to act like a builder, not a boss. Little sister has to speak up about what she needs.  
- I told them I’ll never be mad at them — only at the situation. And that I love them no matter what.

**Notes to Self:**  
- Kid 1 is my strength.  
- Kid 2 is my courage.  
- Mom is my wisdom.  
- I’m not building this just for them — but I’m offering it *to* them.

**Status:**  
Offer made. Waiting for Tuesday.
