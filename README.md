# 🔥 Little Flame, Big Flame  
### A Youth-Powered Candle Project | Built with $12/hr, Purpose, and Grit  
Created by Northern Michigan Firewood Company

---

## 📖 What is this?

_Little Flame, Big Flame_ is a youth-led candle program created to:
- Teach meaningful work at fair wages ($12/hr)
- Provide accessible warmth and light to our neighbors
- **Prove that a youth labor program can be self-funded through Bitcoin**
- Document a new model of community repair and local economic autonomy

This is both a **live case study** and an **open-source blueprint** for anyone seeking to replicate or remix this model.

## 🎥 Why We're Doing This

We believe:
- Social media doesn’t need more clout—it needs more grit.
- Teen labor can be respected, not exploited.
- Real work beats performative posting.
- A candle can carry warmth, care, and a challenge to how we think about value.
- **Bitcoin can serve as a community treasury and economic escape hatch.**

This is not a brand exercise. It’s a theory in motion.  
We’re documenting everything—successes, failures, process, and philosophy.

# 🤝 Support Notes

This folder holds direct support messages from Travis Price and Northern Michigan Firewood Co — written to individuals during moments of need, loss, or transition.

These are not donations.  
These are **investments in people** who build culture, tell the truth, and carry light — even when it’s hard.

We believe in:
- Quiet support that expects nothing in return
- Collaborations born from trust, not contracts
- Building the world we want by backing people we believe in

## ⚠️ Transparency Notice

Northern Michigan Firewood Co operates in **Michigan, a one-party consent state**.  
Any direct messages, calls, or in-person conversations may be documented or summarized internally for continuity, recordkeeping, or reflection — especially when they relate to crew development, mutual aid, or cultural collaboration.

This is never for exploitation. It's for building with clarity, protecting trust, and making sure the stories we tell — and the support we offer — are remembered the way they deserve to be.
