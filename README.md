# 🔥 Little Flame, Big Flame  
### A Youth-Powered Candle Project | Built with $12/hr, Purpose, and Grit  
Created by Northern Michigan Firewood Company

---

## 📖 What is this?

_Little Flame, Big Flame_ is a youth-led candle program created to:
- Teach meaningful work at fair wages ($12/hr)
- Provide accessible warmth and light to our neighbors
- **Prove that a youth labor program can be self-funded through Bitcoin**
- Document a new model of community repair and local economic autonomy

This is both a **live case study** and an **open-source blueprint** for anyone seeking to replicate or remix this model.

## 🎥 Why We're Doing This

We believe:
- Social media doesn’t need more clout—it needs more grit.
- Teen labor can be respected, not exploited.
- Real work beats performative posting.
- A candle can carry warmth, care, and a challenge to how we think about value.
- **Bitcoin can serve as a community treasury and economic escape hatch.**

This is not a brand exercise. It’s a theory in motion.  
We’re documenting everything—successes, failures, process, and philosophy.
