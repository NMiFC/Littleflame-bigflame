# NMFC 13-Episode Strategy & 24-Month App Transition Plan

This document outlines the content architecture and platform strategy for Northern Michigan Firewood Company (NMFC), integrating foundational ethos, a 13-episode YouTube series, a Shorts cadence, and a 24-month transition to a fully independent app-based infrastructure.

---

## 🔥 Phase I: 13-Episode Anchor Series (YouTube Longform)

Each episode is:

* Anchored in a theme song
* Built around a core message (identity, refusal, decentralization, care)
* Accompanied by 2 Shorts per week
* Used to slow-walk the audience toward BTC-based infrastructure and NMFC’s app

🔁 **Short Update**:

* Create a new Short to replace BTC theme from Episode 01:

  * **Title**: "Opting Out Isn’t Hiding"
  * **Theme**: BTC as an exit, not an escape. Quiet sovereignty.
  * **Slot**: Week following Episode 01

---

## 🎥 Weekly Shorts Rhythm

* **2 per week** minimum
* Mix of:

  * Observations (e.g., weather, burned quote lids, wax pouring)
  * Philosophical takes (BTC, care, refusal)
  * Infrastructure previews (treasury, ledger, mural sketch, kiosk prototype)
* Shorts don’t need to sync with episode content exactly but must echo tone and mission

---

## 📲 Phase II: 24-Month App Transition (via YouTube)

### 📅 Phase 0: Foundations (Now – July 2025)

* Publish GitHub-based Field Guide & builder logs
* Begin treasury transparency posts (BTC reserve, care funds)
* Frame all content around "the slow build before the launch"
* Prepare audience for something that **doesn’t require Discord or Telegram**

### 📅 Phase 1: Early App Presence (Aug 2025–Feb 2026)

* Publish a landing page:

  * BTC tip jar
  * Email list form
  * Value explainer (“Why we won’t use platforms we don’t own”)
* Offer downloadable Field Guide sample PDFs (or ledger snapshots)
* Quietly tease: “We’re building a digital HQ”

### 📅 Phase 2: Beta Community Space (Mar–Oct 2026)

* Release soft app beta:

  * Embedded video mirror (YouTube archive + exclusive uploads)
  * Private message form (read-only for crew)
  * Basic merch/candle store
* Host youth ops or early reports in hidden blog section
* BTC-only tip system goes live for supporters

### 📅 Phase 3: App Becomes Home (Nov 2026–July 2027)

* YouTube becomes outreach only
* App becomes HQ for:

  * All youth coordination & internal updates
  * All video, music, ledger, treasury, and culture archives
  * Volunteer onboarding, care referrals, BTC strategy
* Final 13th episode announces shift: "We’re not just making content. We built the infrastructure.”

---

## 💸 Cost Control Notes

* MVP App can be built in Webflow, Framer, or FlutterFlow under \$1,000
* Hosting cost under \$25/mo for basic stack (Firebase + storage + GitHub/CDN)
* BTC tip jar powered by BTCPay Server or self-hosted fallback
* No treasury funds (youth pay, kiosk ops, or candle profit) may be redirected
* Early infrastructure funded via:

  * Merch preorders
  * Tips
  * Voluntary FID contributions

---

## 🧱 Final Notes

* This plan enables NMFC to:

  * Build in public
  * Document rebellion as it happens
  * Maintain full creative control
  * Migrate audience *without losing purpose or sovereignty*
* This document should be updated monthly in GitHub or via AI assistant
* Future entries should be appended to the end with timestamps and initials

**This is not a marketing funnel. It’s a cultural migration.**
