## üß≠ Purpose

This isn‚Äôt for virality. It‚Äôs for those trying to build in a world that rewards noise. It‚Äôs an archive of the quiet, slow, intentional process behind a working-class rebellion disguised as a business.

Every episode is crafted to stand alone, but also to build something cumulative. Over time, it will tell the full story of how we made something real without selling ourselves out.
