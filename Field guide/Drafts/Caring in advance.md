Caring in Advance

We do not own the building. We do not enter it. We do not knock, alter, or announce.

But we care for it.

We care by remembering it. By preparing words we will one day burn inside it. By sketching futures that do not rush. By watching the light shift across its roof from a distance. By telling no one, but never forgetting.

We believe in honoring what is not yet ours. In stewardship before possession. In the slow preparation of sacred things.

Some call it waiting. We call it tending.

Because when the door opens — not by force, not by purchase, but by alignment — we will be ready. Not scrambling, not asking permission, but carrying forward what was already alive in us.

And when we finally step through, we won’t need to explain. The building will know.

Until then: we light candles elsewhere. We burn words in quiet places. We document everything. We say nothing.

This is how we care in advance.
