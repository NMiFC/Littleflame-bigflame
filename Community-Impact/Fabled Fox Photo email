Hey Franchesca,

This isn't charity — it's early investment in your comeback shot. Your lens matters. Your work matters. I'm building something called *Little Flame, Big Flame* — youth-led candles that fund free winter heat. I think your vision belongs in this story.

When you’re ready, let’s collaborate. For now, take this. Heal. And keep building.
