# Letter to Child 1 – Almost 13 (Niece)

Hey kid,

I’m not here to fix anything. I’m not writing some soft “you’re special” letter.

I’m building something, and I think you might be the kind of person who could help build it too — if you’re ready to show up.

It’s called *Little Flame, Big Flame*. It’s real. We make candles to help pay for free heat in the winter for people who are freezing. Every candle means something. Every hour we work means something. It’s not just a nice idea — it’s work that matters.

You’ve got fight in you. That’s rare. A lot of people just fold. You don’t — even when it hurts. That means something to me.

So here’s the offer:

If you want to be part of this, I’ll teach you everything I know. I’ll give you a crew, a role, a fire to help carry. But if you’re in, **you’re in**. No halfway. No quitting the second it feels hard. We don’t care if you’re perfect. We just care if you show up.

You’ll be trusted — but that means you have to be ready to hold that trust.

Think it over. If you say yes, I expect you to mean it.

# Letter to Child 2 – Almost 14 (Smart, Quiet)

Hey there,

I know starting something new can feel like too much. So I’ll be clear.

I’m building something called *Little Flame, Big Flame*. It’s a small crew doing real work. We make candles, and the money from those candles funds heating for people who need it in the winter. That means what we do actually matters — and we need people who can handle that.

I think you could be one of them.

You’re sharp. You think deeply. And even when things get overwhelming, you keep going. That’s the kind of mind I trust.

Here’s the deal:

If you want in, I’ll teach you the system. I’ll work around your style. I won’t expect perfection, and I won’t rush you. But if you say yes, **you’re on the crew**. That means showing up even when your head’s noisy. It means helping hold up your end even when it’s a little tough.

This is not a drop-in activity. It’s a build team. You’ll be trusted — and that trust means something.

So if you're in, I expect it to *mean something* to you too.

Let me know.

— [Your Name]
